# FiiSoft Filesystem

Yet another abstraction of filesystem. Nothing interesting.

My advice is - do not use it unless you are enough strong mentally to immune for such bad code. 

#### `FileLocation`

Represents location that contains files. Allows to list files in this location, and also reads their content and write them.
